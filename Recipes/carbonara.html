                    <h1 id="title">Spaghetti Carbonara</h1>
                    <p>This easy pasta sauce will cook in about the same time it takes to cook some dried pasta in 
                        boiling salted water - we're talking about quick and easy options here. 
                        These amounts serve 2 but are easy to scale up or down.
                        Remember you want about 75g of dried pasta per person - use whatever 
                        shape you've got. Or, check out my super-simple method for fresh pasta, using just flour and water.

                    <ul>
                        <li>150 g dried spaghetti</li>
                        <li>2 rashers of higher-welfare smoked streaky bacon</li>
                        <li>1/2 tbsp olive oil</li>
                        <li>2 free-range eggs</li>
                        <li>30 g Parmesan cheese, plus extra for grating</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Cook the pasta in a pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions.</li>
                        <li>Slice the bacon and place in a non-stick frying pan on a medium heat with half a tablespoon of olive oil and a really good pinch of black pepper. Leave it to get super-golden and crispy, tossing occasionally, then turn off the heat.</li>
                        <li>Meanwhile, beat the eggs in a bowl, then finely grate in the Parmesan and mix well.</li>
                        <li> Pour the Parmesan eggs into the pan, and keep everything moving, loosening with splashes of the pasta cooking water until you have a silky sauce. Make sure the pan is not too hot otherwise the eggs will scramble.</li>
                        <li>Plate up the pasta, and finish with an extra grating of Parmesan.</li>
                    </ol>
